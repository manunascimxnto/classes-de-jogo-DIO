# 🧙‍♂️ Game Classes

> This project was developed as part of the bootcamp **Programação do Zero (Programming from Scratch)**, by [Digital Innovation One (DIO)](https://www.dio.me/)**, carried out in *2023*. The goal was to practice basic programming concepts in **JavaScript**, such as variables, operators, loops, decision structures, functions, classes, and objects.

## 🛠️ Skills developed in the bootcamp:
- Programming Logic
- Problem Solving
- JavaScript
- Git
- GitHub
- Agile Methodologies (Scrum)

## 🎯 Goal

Create a generic class that represents a hero in an adventure, with the following properties:

- `name`
- `age`
- `type` (e.g., warrior, mage, monk, ninja)

In addition, implement a method called **`attack()`**, which displays a personalized message according to the hero’s type: 

- mage → *used magic*
- warrior → *used sword*
- monk → *used martial arts*
- ninja → *used shuriken*

--- 

## 🚀 Usage Example

```javascript const hero1 = new Heroi("Arthus", 30, "warrior"); console.log(hero1.attack()); // Output: "The warrior attacked using sword" const hero2 = new Heroi("Merlin", 150, "mage");
